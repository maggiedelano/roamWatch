# roamWatch
Watch blocks refs to your blocks in a multiplayer graph!

To use, download the .json file and import it into your graph, then configure the display name and page in the roam/js block. Be sure to create the page first, and back up your graph. Video: https://www.loom.com/share/7f157353f1374fce85071affbe383494
